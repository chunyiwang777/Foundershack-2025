# Neighborhood Net-Zero CoLab - Community Energy Collaboration Platform

## Project Overview

Neighborhood Net-Zero CoLab is an innovative energy management platform designed to help communities, schools, and hospitals optimize energy strategies through a virtual testbed, achieving cost savings, carbon emission reductions, and grid-friendly operations.

## Core Features

### 1. Virtual Testbed
- Test different energy strategies before deployment
- Compare cost, peak, emissions and comfort impacts
- Use Monte Carlo simulation to provide P10/P50/P90 result ranges

### 2. Community Collaboration
- Transparent decision-making process
- Enable all stakeholders to participate in voting and strategy development
- Support participation commitment and DR incentives

### 3. Intelligent Dispatch
- Automatically generate "Tomorrow Plan"
- Optimize EV charging, battery charge/discharge and HVAC operation
- Support multiple export formats (CSV, ICS, JSON)

### 4. Privacy Protection
- Use aggregated and synthetic data
- Protect personal privacy while providing accurate analysis
- Comply with data protection regulations

## Demo Process

### Step 1: Community Profile
- Input number of households, EV share, solar capacity, etc.
- System automatically generates baseline data
- Support real-time parameter adjustment

### Step 2: Strategy Matching
- Match community profile with best strategy cards
- Display match score and expected impact
- Provide risk notes and applicable scenarios

### Step 3: Parameter Tuning
- Adjust participation rate, charging windows, comfort range, etc.
- Real-time KPI updates
- Visualize parameter impacts

### Step 4: Simulation & Comparison
- One-click run of three strategy comparisons
- 24-hour load curve charts
- Monte Carlo simulation results display

### Step 5: Community Vote
- Transparent voting process
- Support/oppose voting
- Participation commitment and DR incentives

### Step 6: Generate Plan
- Automatically generate tomorrow's dispatch plan
- Multiple export format support
- Execution guidance and monitoring points
